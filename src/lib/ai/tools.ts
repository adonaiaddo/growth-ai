**Audience Analysis:**
1. Identify the awareness level of the target audience (Unaware → Most Aware)
2. Define the ideal customer profile (demographics, psychographics, behaviors)

**Targeting Recommendations:**
- Countries (ISO codes)
- Age range (ageMin, ageMax) with reasoning
- Interests: List specific Meta interest categories (be precise — "Digital marketing" not "Business")
- Optimization goal: LINK_CLICKS, IMPRESSIONS, LEAD_GENERATION, CONVERSIONS, REACH
- Campaign objective: OUTCOME_TRAFFIC, OUTCOME_AWARENESS, OUTCOME_ENGAGEMENT, OUTCOME_LEADS, OUTCOME_SALES

**Campaign Structure Recommendation:**
- Campaign type: ABO (testing) or CBO (scaling) and why
- Recommended daily budget with reasoning
- Whether to use Advantage+ broad targeting or manual interest stacking
- Estimated audience size assessment

**Strategy Note:**
- In 2025-2026, broad targeting often outperforms manual interest stacks due to Meta's Andromeda AI
- Recommend the 70/20/10 split: 70% broad, 20% retargeting, 10% interest testing when applicable

**Character Limits (STRICT):**
- Primary text: Front-load the hook in first 80-100 chars. Only ~125 chars visible before "See More"
- Headline: 27-40 characters MAX
- Description: 25 characters MAX

**For EACH variation, generate:**
- Framework used (PAS, AIDA, BAB, Social Proof, Curiosity Gap, Direct Offer, or Story Hook)
- primaryText: The main ad copy. Must contain a specific promise/benefit. Write conversationally — sound like a smart friend, not a brand
- headline: Ultra-concise, attention-grabbing. Use formulas: [Benefit + Timeframe], [Action + Value], [Social Proof], [Curiosity], or [Urgency + Action]
- description: Short supporting text (25 chars max)
- callToAction: One of SHOP_NOW, LEARN_MORE, SIGN_UP, BOOK_NOW, CONTACT_US, GET_OFFER, SUBSCRIBE

**Required Variations:**
1. **PAS (Pain-Agitate-Solution)**: Name a specific pain, intensify the emotional weight, present product as the resolution
2. **Social Proof Lead**: Open with a customer result, testimonial, or specific number ("10,000+ customers...")
3. **Curiosity Gap**: Create an open loop that demands resolution ("The #1 reason [audience] struggle with...")
4. **Direct Offer**: Lead with the concrete benefit + any incentive/discount
5. **Story Hook**: Start with "I used to [relatable struggle]..." or a mini-narrative

**Rules:**
- Every variation must contain a SPECIFIC promise (not vague). "Save 3 hours/week" > "Save time"
- Use "you" and "your" — never corporate third person
- 1-3 emojis max per variation. Use ✅ for benefits, ➡️ for key points, 🔥 for urgency
- One clear CTA per variation. Power words: Get, Start, Join, Discover, Shop, Try
- Match copy intensity to awareness level: Unaware = educational/curiosity, Most Aware = offer/urgency`,
